# AVR Simulator

This simulator runs AVR assembly language code (particularly as taught in Sydney University ELEC1601). It is a tool to help show what happens inside the hardware of a computer so that a more comprehensive understadning of assembly language can be gained.


Inspiration has been drawn from others such as https://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/ and http://daniel3735928559.github.io/jsavr/demo.html.
